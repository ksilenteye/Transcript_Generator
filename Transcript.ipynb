      "If you're worried about buying a business that will drain your savings and take years to be profitable, you're not alone. That is the number one fear I hear from people that are looking to buy their first business. But after doing seven acquisitions myself and helping hundreds of students to do the same, I can tell you that there is a clear formula for finding businesses that will put money in your pocket on day one. Today I'm going to show you exactly how to find those cash flowing opportunities and avoid the money pits that trap first time buyers. Here's the right approach when it comes to finding the right business. Number one, you're going to focus on existing cash flow, not potential. This is one of the biggest traps that most people get themselves into. They look at a business, they think of all the things that they can do to make this business better. You do not value a business on potential. You value a business on past performance, the last three years of performance. Whatever potential you think it has, that is no value. The only value it has is what it's done. That's the only thing you can point towards. That is the hard data. You want to look for stability over growth potential. We want businesses that have a steady revenue growth and steady cash flow growth. We do not want businesses that show an erratic chart of one year they're up, the next year they're down. We always prioritize the stability, not the sexiness of the business itself. And which leads me to saying that I like boring rather than exciting. Because boring is something that is consistent, has some type of recurring value to it and people need it. Which is why we think it's boring. Because all of us know what it is. We have all used it before. It's not exciting, right? All of us think AI and all these cool new startup ideas. Yeah, that's exciting, but that's not what we want to buy. That's a lot of risk. High risk, high reward. We want things that are low risk but also have an amazing reward. And that's what we're going after Now. Here is the wrong approach. This is what I do not want you to do do. Buying a turnaround or fixer upper. When we come to businesses, there's going to be a lot of businesses you look at that are turnarounds or fixer uppers. They're just not good, they're losing money, they're barely making money. They have horrible operations, a horrible product. There are people who have skill sets that are suited to that and they are the minority. They're very special people that Take on that risk and they know what they're doing. That is not you. That is not me. Even after all the experience I have now, I would never take on a turnaround or a fixer upper. Do not trace trends. Something comes out, it's a new concept or hey, it's, it's now, you know the pet cleaning business, but now it has AI with it. All that throw it to the side. You focus on simple, understandable businesses. Another big mistake is thinking that you're going to figure it out after buying it. No, you're going to figure it out during the due diligence phase before you buy it. Because if you can't figure it out or it's not as good as you thought, you're going to be able to get away scot free, not lose money, not waste your time and not waste your energy. You're not going to figure it out after purchasing it. That needs to be all figured out before the purchase. Last believe that you can quickly improve operations. Not going to happen. Now there are certain people out there that have just gurus at operations. They're amazing at it and they can do a lot of fixing in a short period of time. That is not 99% of us, myself included. It doesn't take a short period of time, it takes a long period of time to make operations work well. So when you're focusing in on what your projections might be or what the business is going to do, or how much time you're going to put into it, always double that amount of time you think it's going to be. And probably it's going to be longer than that. Here are the three pillars of cash flow. Number one, recession resistance. Now I talk about this all often. We only focus on boring businesses, businesses that people need. Regardless if there's a recession or if we're in an economic boom. These are services that you and I use on a daily, weekly, monthly, yearly basis. Perfect example. Accounting firms. What I'm focusing on right now in my roll up strategy, why are accounting firms recurring or recession resistant? Is because every year people have to do taxes. Every year businesses need their bookkeeping done. Every month businesses need payroll done. These are services that are recession resistant. You can also, if you want to take your research even deeper, look for businesses that did well in the last recession. Go back to 2008, 9, 10, 11. You look at the businesses that did find the industries that went through it without really having that much of a disturbance. I guarantee if you did, you would see that they were all boring. Businesses and they were all essential businesses avoid luxury and discretionary spending businesses. These are businesses that are luxury items. Think about, when I think of this, I think of Crumble Cookie. Now don't get me wrong, I love the cookies at Crumble Cookie. They're delicious. Nothing against them, but would you think that is a recession resistant business or do you think that is a luxury item? Discretionary spending. And the answer of course is a luxury item. No one who lost their job or is now making half of what they used to make is going to spend $8 on a cookie, right? It just doesn't make any sense. They're going to use that towards things that they need. When you're looking at these types of deals, think in your head, is this something that I would need even if my income got cut in half? The second pillar is recurring revenue. Now I don't mean subscription, I mean recurring. So the way I kind of put this into a model is this is something that someone would do more than once a year, right? They would this service at least two times a year, if not more. So this kind of wipes out a lot of the construction based businesses like kitchen remodelers. When you remodel someone's kitchen, you're not going to remodel it twice in one year. It'll probably be once every 10 years. That wouldn't be recurring. Now that like I mentioned, there's a lot of different types of recurring business. There's subscriptions. That's when you think of like kind of your SaaS, you have products that need to be sold or people need to buy on a weekly or monthly basis. You have service contracts and maintenance contracts that have to be done every single month or every single six months or every quarter. And the last pillar is the barrier to entry. Now think of this as a moat around the castle, right? So you have the castle, you got a moat of water around it. Now what was the purpose of the moat is so that an evading army can't scale the castle walls to get in. It's the same thing when we're talking about business and industries. You want to have a moat around your business. There's something that makes it hard to compete against your business. So if you have an accounting firm, for example, not everyone can start an accounting firm tomorrow. You need some type of experience or license, educational requirement to start to compete. An example of an industry that doesn't have that, especially on a small scale, is landscaping. Anyone can go buy a mower at Home Depot and mow someone's lawn and get paid for it. You want to choose an industry that has a moat. The bigger the moat, the better. Some of those moats can take form in licensing. Some of those moats can be geographic in nature, meaning there's not enough of a population for a competitor to pop up and take your clientele so they just never bother. Sometimes that is just years and reputation. Some of the businesses that you'll be looking to acquire might be 50, 70 years old. For someone to come in and take those customers that have been using you for 50 to 70 years, multi generations is a very high bar for them to get a pass. Here are some financial red flags that you need to look for when you're looking at a deal. If you see declining revenue as a trend over the past three years, drop the deal. In almost every scenario, drop it. If you see inconsistent cash flow month to month and it's not explainable through things that might make sense like equipment purchases, or maybe you're hiring more people because you're scaling at a much faster rate than than you thought. If there's inconsistent cash flow and there's not a good explanation for it, drop it. If there is a heavy reliance on owner relationships, in most cases this is a red flag. Now there are some cases where if you keep the owner on you give them equity, you can minimize that risk. But if he wants to leave day one after selling and he's very heavily involved with some of your biggest relationships that are driving revenue, drop the deal. Customer concentration is one of the most common ones. This is where I want to see no greater than 10% of revenue coming from one client. There'll be times where deals get done where that's not the case, where it's 50%, 15 or 20%. But those are backstopped by a very solid contract. Maybe it's a multi year contract. Maybe it's something where you're the only one who has access because of a geographical hedge or anything else to those contracts. There are some things out there that can minimize that risk. But if you have more than 10% of revenue coming from one client, that is customer concentration. And typically I want you to leave it. Here are some warning signs that you need to take heed of. If there are no financial systems or reporting their books are a mess, you have really no idea how much they're making. Big red flag if it's a cash heavy business. And again with poor records. I had a student who just had a deal like this where they had a Pilates studio and the Pilates studio owner that sold it to my student only got paid via check or cash and the student bought the deal based on the tax returns. Turns out, in the student's favor, this business was making way more money than she thought because the owner wasn't reporting all the income. She reported some income on the tax returns and pay taxes on it. But there's probably a 30% to 40% bump in revenue that she was just straight pocketing and not reporting on. Now that is pretty common in small businesses. It is also a warning flag. Now it worked in my student's favor because the business was making more than she thought. But many times those businesses are making less than what you think. So if you see that it is a red flag if they have recent significant price increases, right? Because the owners is going to sell so they want to make more money to show on their book and also show more cash flow. So they just raise prices to a degree where they haven't before. If this is within market, that's fine, but this is something where they raise it above market to get a temporary boost in sales before they gradually start to decline because they're just too expensive. That is something to look for as well and is a big warning sign. Now the biggest one that people come upon is deferred maintenance. This is where you are buying a company that has a lot of equipment, that equipment is 20 years old and they are giving you that equipment with the sale. But you don't realize. Like a good example would be a Laundromat. Buy a Laundromat, the numbers look good, the margins look great. But you don't realize as soon as you buy it that these machines are over 25 years old, they have to be replaced in the next year. And then you have to spend a half a million dollars on new machines or fixing the old ones, which is going to cost you a couple hundred thousand dollars. That's something you didn't take into consideration. And now that profitable business just gave you a loss in the next year. Okay, so these are warning signs that you need to make sure on the diligent side, you're doing appraisal of all the equipment and understanding what the depreciation life cycle is and how much useful life these machines still have. And last but not least is high employee turnover. If you get into a business and you're in the due diligence phase and you start to realize that they've had three GMs in the past year. They' had the average life cycle of an employee is under A year. Then this is a business with a high turnover and the retention costs of having employees leave consistently and you going out recruiting new ones and training new ones to have them leave six to nine months later. That is a huge cost to a business and it's very hard to scale a business like that. So if you see that, that is a huge warning sign. Now here are some of the operational criteria that we want to see in that business. One, we want to see that there's an existing GM that is running the business. That is ideal, that is what we're looking for. Because the owner is not doing the GMs. The GM is doing that. He's not in the day to day and that's who you're going to replace. That's what we want. We want clear roles and responsibilities, right? We want every single person on that org chart, they have a defined role that has defined responsibilities. That way when you're in the diligence phase and you're looking at how everything works, it's very understandable. You're able to point to certain roles and certain responsibilities and understand the life cycle of how a client runs through that business. And it makes perfect sense and you understand it a hundred percent. That's what we want. We want documented processes and procedures. Now they might not be documented in the way that you want them to be. They might be in some folder on the desk of the general manager, but we want them documented because if it's documented, it can be repeated and there can be a standard. And both are essential to a successful business. You might take over this business. You might need to replace somebody that leaves in a short period of order right after it. And you want to be able to train that person coming on so they can be as effective and bringing value to the team as fast as possible. Team quality is hugely important. We want low turnover and high quality people. Now how do we do that? We have to incentivize them. We have to pay our employees well. We have to put, and I'm a big fan of putting a bonus structure in place where when the company wins, your employees win. And so now they see a direct correlation between me doing a good job and me getting a better paycheck. And people all operate on incentives. We want a positive workplace culture. And this is something that's totally intuitive to you who are listening to this video right now. You don't want to work somewhere where you're not treated with respect, where your abilities aren't encouraged, and you feel like every day waking up and Going to work is a battle. No one wants to do that. They want to go to a place where they feel encouraged, that they feel valued and that they see a future for themselves. So create that environment for your employees. And if the environment does not exist, that's something that's going to be day one, you working on and building it. And last, when it comes to team quality, we want cross training. There's going to be times where someone is going to abruptly leave your company. Maybe they had an issue that popped up, maybe a health scare and they have to leave. You have to cross train employees to in the interim while you're looking for someone to replace them, other employees can pick up the slack. Here are some really good industries for day one cash flow. I mentioned this multiple times in this video, but home services, home services are going to be H Vac, you're going to be plumbing, going to be landscaping. Now landscaping at a certain level, I only look at businesses in the landscaping industry above a million in revenue because we do not want to be competing on price, we want to be competing on service and efficiency. Also pest control, right there's roofing and there's a couple others out there. These are great businesses for day one cash flow. Professional services. This is kind of where I'm focusing on accounting firms. That's my number one that I like to focus on. And I'm going out there and acquiring as many as I can. Day one cash flow. These are super profitable businesses. They're recurring, they're recession resistant and they have a barrier to entry. Commercial services like cleaning, waste management, these are things that are needed, these are things that are recurring, these are things that there's a barrier to entry, just like the other ones I mentioned. And day one that can be very profitable. And then B2B service providers. Now this, there's a million different types of B2B service providers. But B2B for those of you watching, is business to business. Your customer is other businesses. And you want to focus on services that they'll need on a recurring basis. And you want to be able to do it in a geographic hedge region. Now here are some industries to avoid. Now there's a caveat here. If you have specific experience in these industries, this might not apply to you. You might have the, you have the knowledge and the expertise and the network to do well in these. But for my average student who doesn't have expertise in these industries, stay away. Number one, restaurants. Restaurants are super low margin, very hard to run, very hard to have a successful one. Don't go into it unless you have experience retail business without recurring customers. Okay, so think about like this is your high end clothing store or something of like a less you have specific networking and contacts and experience. If you don't have that, do not go into that industry. Construction. Now I get a pushback on this because there are very profitable construction. One of my good friends runs an extremely profitable construction company. But guess what, he has a background in it. He's done it for a decade plus. He has a great vast network in it and he's very good what he does. I'm not talking to him, I'm talking to you out there who's maybe never swung a hammer like myself. Buying a construction company when it comes with the labor issues as well as the non recurring nature of it does not fit the model that we're looking for. And as I mentioned before, do not go after those trendy type businesses. The crumble cookies of the world. Don't do it. They look cool, they may taste great. Don't go after them. Now where to look to find these companies. Now you might be at this point in the video where you're like okay, Ben has convinced me, he's convinced me that this is a way to go out and build wealth and there's a process and there's a strategy. Okay, I'm with them. Where do you start? Best place to go is SMB Market. On that site you're going to be able to not only search businesses from every different platform, it takes it from every platform out there and puts it into one place. So Biz, Buy, Sell and LoopNet and all the ones you can think of Flippa, they're all could be found on smbmarket.com so it puts them all into one place, it aggregates them and you can put in your own filters and searches and everything else to only look at the ones that are profitable in the realm that you are interested in being profitable. And it's getting better every day. We're putting a bunch of deal calculators and everything else in it. So check out SMB market.com now business brokers, they're the people who the sellers are going to to get prepared to sell. Also a great resource to talk to. Their whole job is to try to sell you the business. So understand that they're a salesperson trying to sell a business so they get paid but they're also going to have the most in depth information about their business outside the seller. Now I'm a fan of this one is direct Outreach to sellers. So we're kind of bypassing brokers and going directly to a potential seller. They're not selling yet. That's why they don't have a broker. They're interested in selling, but they don't, they're not talking to brokers yet. So you're reaching out in a cold outreach, calling them on the phone, sending a cold email, putting out ads where they're clicking on it and you're having a direct conversation with a person who wants to sell their business. Business that is the best because now you're controlling the entire arrangement of that deal. You're gonna have a better price, you're a better structure, most likely. Now the other side of it is you're going to put a lot more work in because the broker is the one who helps them consolidate their financials, get all their stuff together. Now you as a buyer are going to have to do that. Now it's still, I think the opportunity outweighs the cost. But just be aware, it's going to take a lot more work and one that people always overlook. And it's funny because I have a lot of students who will come back to me say, hey, I finally found a deal when I just told my network and people that I knew about what I was doing. This is some of the best ways to find deals, especially off market. Just tell your family, your friends, your network, your church, your sports group, whatever you're doing, just tell them what you're doing. This is just the pro tip for this video. Tell people in your network what you're doing and most likely they're going to point you in the direction of someone who wants to sell their business. Now here is what to ask when you're talking to that seller who wants to sell their business. And this is again, this is coming from the, mostly from an off market, but this also with on market when you're talking to a broker. So you can ask a seller or broker these questions. Number one, why are you selling the business? Best reason for us as searchers are they're retiring. They're 60 plus years old, they want to retire. They have a great business, they're looking for the next phase of life. Next question is how much time do you spend in the business? Remember, we're trying to get to the heart of the question of how active are they in the business? Because if they are working 40 hours a week, we know we need to replace them with somebody else who works in the business or yourself. And so that already off the back can tell you if you want the deal or not. So that's key. So how much do you work in the business? What are you actually doing in the business? What are your actual tasks that you're working in the business? Because they might tell you, I do payroll, I do some scheduling and I do the occasional sale. Well, that that's something you can replace fairly easily. But if they're the person who's managing the teams, quality control, they're doing one, doing the bids, that's much harder to replace. What percentage of the business is repeat customers? This is getting back to our pillar of recurring revenue. If someone comes and does business with you, how often are they staying with you now? A lot of times. They'll give you a generic answer. Oh, a lot or most. You want to get details. They might not have that data on hand, but you want to get details. How did your business perform during COVID That's a great, great way of doing a litmus test test. If this business is something that is recession resistant, how do they do? Did they almost close? Do they have to only survive by getting a government loan? What did that look like for them? And last is what systems do they have documented? Do you have any systems documented? Do you have any processes documented? If it's a no, just know on the front end there's gonna be a lot more work and take a lot more time to make this business operationally efficient. If you want to learn more about how to find and acquire cash flowing businesses, I have something for you. I have a program called Acquisition Ace where we hold your hand through the whole acquisition process. We've helped hundreds of students acquire businesses that were profitable from day one. If you want to learn more and hear the stories about our successful students and how they did their deals, check out the link in the description below. Thanks for watching.\n"
